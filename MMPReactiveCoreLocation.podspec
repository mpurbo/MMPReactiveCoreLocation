                       MMPReactiveCoreLocation is a reactive library for using CoreLocation and iBeacon with ReactiveCocoa. 

                       Features:
                       * Singleton instance managing CLLocationManager(s). 
                       * Easy to use signals for subscribing to location updates.
                       * 3 common usage patterns: global location manager for app-wide location subscription; short-lived location managers for one-time location requests; subscribing to multiple custom location managers with different specifications.
                       * Easy to use signals for subscribing to iBeacon monitoring and ranging.
                       * Supports iOS 8 "Always" and "WhenInUse" authorization.
